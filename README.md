# Sci-kitlearn-Classifiers-for-Predicting-Loan-Defaults

In this Project Customer data is used to predict a label as a default or not.

The features are removed of nulls and visualized , then the data is changed to convert categorical variables to binary 

variables using a one hot code technique. The data is then normalized and then the following models are ran :

K nearest neigbor, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression. Each models accuracy is then visualized

using a Confusion matrix which shows the errors given by the model as False Positives and False Negatives. The Jaccard 

index and F1 score is then plotted.
